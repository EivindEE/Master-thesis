While marking up http://southernafricatravel.com
================================================

One thing that should be kept in mind is that several of the pages that contain schema.org contains invalid markup.
Attributes that should be resources are instead declared as literals.
A decision should be made on wheter to allow or disallow this type of invalid markup.

The tool is already an improvement in the sense that it lists all the real properties of a type,
but doesn't give the user the posibility to use undocumented markup.


For some reason, the schema testing tool doesn't pick up my rdfa for articles.
They're declare the same way as all the other nodes, but for some reason they are simply ignored.
