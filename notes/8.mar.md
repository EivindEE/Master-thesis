I encountered a problem while trying to markup http://reviews.ctswholesalesunglasses.com.
The site uses javascript to load parts of the page. In particular, it used it to load the part of the page containing the schema markup.
Other sites using javascript to load content would face similar problems as the tool created simply loads the html without executing the javascript.
Executing the code would not be feasable either as it might depend on the context of the document, and might only be accesible from within the same domain.
